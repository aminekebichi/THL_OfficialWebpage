TODO list

- Stylize for mobile view (dynamic styling)
    > Mobile view of shop should show full screen
    images, single column format
    >UPDATE: this is mostly done, just need to
    figure out a way to dynamically style the bag
    flyout
    >POTENTIAL CONCERNS: images will need to be
    checked for stretching/sizing issues when
    assets are finished & uploaded
- Setup backend for inventory tracking
- Generate email for purchase confirmation
- Learn about cookies
    > I'm fairly certain that if a user presses
    the back button on their browser, or refreshes
    the page, they will lose all their progress 
    (that being the current items in their cart)
    > I believe the solution is looking into
    cookies as they save information within each
    session to preserve anything a user might 
    want to revisit after refreshing or pressing
    back button

- FINAL ITEM LIST FOR THLFW24
    > La Cantine
    > MYFP Hoodie (Matcha/Black)
    > DFTTYGAWYS Hoodie (Green/Brown)
    > THL Headscarf (Brown/Yellow/Green/Blue)
    > Bracelet? Necklace? Pants?
